### Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the dynamics of the data job market, with a special emphasis on data analysis roles. This project reflects a journey to uncover top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.
Feel free to explore the SQL queries here: [sql_project folder](/sql_project/)
### Background
This project was initiated to gain a deeper understanding of the data analyst job market and to identify the skills that command the highest compensation and are in high demand.
The data utilized for this analysis originates from Luke Barousseâ€™s SQL Course, available at ([SQL for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)). This dataset comprises comprehensive information encompassing job titles, salaries, locations, and requisite skills.
The primary inquiries addressed through my SQL queries were as follows:

1. What are the highest-paying data analyst positions?
2. Which skills are prerequisites for these top-paying roles?
3. What skills are predominantly sought after by employers for data analyst positions?
4. Are there specific skills correlated with elevated salary levels?
5. Which skills present the most advantageous prospects for data analysts aiming to maximize their market value?
### Tools
In this project, I employed a diverse array of tools to conduct my analysis, including:
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): This language enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and address key questions through tailored queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: Serving as the chosen database management system, PostgreSQL facilitated the storage, querying, and manipulation of the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Leveraging this open-source administration and development platform, I managed the database and executed SQL queries efficiently.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

### The Analysis
Each query within this project was dedicated to examining particular aspects of the data analyst job market. 

#### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs:

In the pursuit of identifying the highest-paying roles, filters were applied to data analyst positions based on their average yearly salary and location, with a particular emphasis on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
	name AS company_name
FROM
	job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
	job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
	AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
	AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
	salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
